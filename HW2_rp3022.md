Homework 2
================

### Problem 0

Created an R project - p8105_hw2_rp3022 and a subdirectory “data” to
store all the files to be used for the homework. Loading the required
libraries

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

### Description of the dataset:

The total number of observations (rows) are **641** and the total number
of variables(columns) are **15**.The names of the variables are
**dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards,
plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles,
grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls, homes_powered, wheel** The
**numeric variables** are weight_tons : the weight of trash collected,

variables to calculate number of plastic bottles , polystyrene,
cigarette butts, glass bottles, grocery bags, chips bags, sports balls
collected and number of homes empowered. The **character variables** are
year and month and there is a **date variable**. The total weight of
trash collected by Professor trash wheel is **190.12** tons The total

-   The dataset **pols-month.csv** describes the number of national
    politicians who were either democratic or republic at a given time.
    It initially had 822 observations and 9 variables. Individual
    columns of “prez_dem” and “prez_gop” were combined to create
    “president” column. The variable mon was divided into 3 variables
    “year”, “month”,and “day. The resulting data set **“pols_df** had
    **822** observations, **9 variables**. The variables were **year,
    month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem,
    president** and the range of years was **1947, 2015**

-   The dataset **snp.csv** describes the closing values of S&P stock
    index at a given time period. It initially had 787 observations and
    2 variables. No columns or observations were added or removed. The
    resulting data set **“snp_df** had **787 observations** and **3
    variables**. The variables were **year, month, close** and the range
    of years was **1950, 2015**

-   The dataset **unemployment.csv** provides information about
    percentage of unemployment at a given time. It initially had 68
    observations and 13 variables.The dataset was switched from a wide
    to a long format. The resulting dataset **“unemp_df”** had **816
    observations** and **3 variables**. The variables were **year,
    month, unemployment** and the range of years was **1948, 2015**

-   The **first combined dataset “pomo_snp”** was created using dataset
    pols_df and snp_df. It had **822 observations** and **10 variables**
    and the range of years was **1947, 2015** It had variables **year,
    month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem,
    president, close**.

-   The **second combined dataset “pomo_unemp\*\* was created by
    merging”pomo_snp” and “unemp_df”. It has **822 observations\*\* and
    **11 variables**. The range of years is **1947, 2015**. It has
    variables **year, month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem,
    sen_dem, rep_dem, president, close, unemployment**
